#####    composer create-project laravel/laravel --prefer-dist admin-app   #####


--prefer-dist and --prefer-source are the two options of composer which included in various documentations with a lack of proper explanation.

--prefer-dist would try to download and unzip archives of the dependencies using GitHub or another API when available. This is used for faster downloading of dependencies in most cases. It doesn't download the whole VCS history of the dependencies and it should be better cached. Also archives on GitHub could exclude some files you don't need for just using the dependency with .gitattributes exclude directive.

--prefer-source would try to clone and keep the whole VCS repository of the dependencies when available. This is useful when you want to have the original VCS repositories cloned in your vendor/ folder. E.g. you might want to work on the dependencies - modify them, fork them, submit pull requests etc. while also using them as part of the bigger project which requires them in the first place.

Simply speaking, the --prefer-source option will prefer to create a package directory that is a "version control repository", which is equivalent to you typing:


## react bootstrap table installation error

npm install react-bootstrap-table-next --save

this command line showing error

fixed commad line: npm install react-bootstrap-table-next --save --legacy-peer-deps
